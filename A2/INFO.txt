Starvation can happen using this monitor. The reason is that if a specific quadrant that a car in 
a lane has to acquire is always occpuied by the other car from other lanes, then it never gets the 
chance to enter the intersection. And scheduling priority of different cars in different lanes is 
OS-dependent. It may be the case that other lanes keep filling its buffers and keep pushing its 
cars to cross the intersection and would occupy a specific quadrant every time, then the car in 
that specific lane is unable to acquire the lock of this specific quadrant. It has to wait there 
until the OS decides to let it go first. This is where the starvation arises.
