We also implement rm and restore for symlink.

Notice:
When testing with ext2_cp with file size spanning over 12 blocks, readimage executable's
(which is given in the assignment website)output of singly indirect block is not as 
expected. The singly indirect block should output the block numbers that has been 
assigned to hold extra space that the file needs. Instead, it print out all 0s for 
block numbers stored in singly indirect block. I gdb into the program and see that the 
memory space allocated for singly indirect block has been assigned values of those block
numbers. It is a little weired because what the output show is not exactly as what I see 
inside the running time of the program. However, allocation and bitmap update do succeed
to indicate we have copied the content into the blocks. And I test readimage with largefile
(which is also given in the assignment website), the result is the same, it does not output 
the block numbers that are in the singly indirect block.
